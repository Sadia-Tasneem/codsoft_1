During my internship at Codsoft, I was tasked with three diverse and challenging projects. I developed a chatbot, which involved understanding natural language processing and user interaction design. I also created a Tic Tac Toe game, focusing on game logic and user interface. Additionally, I built recommendation systems, where I gained insights into data filtering techniques and user preference prediction. These projects helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and broaden my understanding of software development.
